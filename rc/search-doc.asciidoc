= search-doc.kak

**search-doc.kak** is a [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) plugin that
provides a command for opening the kakoune documentation for a specific item.
The command, `:search-doc`, is an alternative to the built in command `:doc`
and it comes with the advantages that

- it jumps to a much more detailed location, and

- it shows completion options in a more informative way.

== Commands

*search-doc* <topic>::
    display documentation about a topic. The completion list displays the
    available topics

For example, the following command jumps to documentation for the key 'a'

-------------------------------------
:sd 'a (keys: Changes)'
-------------------------------------

== Options

*search_doc_path* `str-list`::
    A list of directories from where search-doc looks for documentation recursively.
