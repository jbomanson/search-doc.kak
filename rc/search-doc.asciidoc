= search-doc.kak

**search-doc.kak** is a [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) plugin that
provides a command for opening the kakoune documentation for a specific item.
The command, `:search-doc`, is an alternative to the built in command `:doc`
and it comes with the advantages that

- it jumps to a much more detailed location, and

- it shows completion options in a more informative way.
